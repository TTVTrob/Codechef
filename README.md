TILTFIRE is a fast-paced 1v1 arena shooter where movement, timing, and mind games decide victory. You and a smart Boss are locked in a split arena, unable to cross the center line. Charge shots trade ammo for power, while the adaptive Boss predicts, feints, panics, and punishes mistakes. Skill over speed.
